#list 
my_list=[1,2,3,5,7]
# print(my_list)

#append
my_list.append(9)
# print(my_list) #save and re run to see the changes

#remove 
my_list.remove(3)
 # 3 has been removed from list

#pop
my_list.pop(2)
 # we count as 0,1,2 so on 2nd number 5 has been popped.

#index
index=my_list.index(2) #change bracket type and save rerun 


# print("count number of number '7' is :",count)

#so suppose i add more number dupicates then it will give specifi ccount for that number let see by appending one number
# updtaed_count=my_list.append(7)
# print(updtaed_count)

#that means you have to append in my_list 
my_list.append(7)
# print(my_list)
#well now will see again the count it will tell two now


#count
count=my_list.count(7)
# print("the count of number '7' is :",count)


# print(my_list) #save and run
#so as it was already sorted lets append some number random then again we will sort 

my_list.extend([34,2,33,12,71])
#now we will sort this 

#sort

my_list.sort()
# so you can see how we sorted the list

#reverse 
my_list.reverse()
# print(my_list)

#nested
nested=[[0,1,3],[1,2,3]]
print(nested[1][0])
print(nested[1][1])
# so as we saw not only makkhan part of fast execution but also understand if row matrix 2by3 so we can have data 
#for 3by2 or 3by3 also we saw some error as bracket related which are very case sensitive so while code make sure to use comma 
# and tell me in video whoch section you like the most error solving or errorless solution or both.
