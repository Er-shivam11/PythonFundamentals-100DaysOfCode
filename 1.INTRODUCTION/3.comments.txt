Comments: Comments are used to annotate code, providing explanations or notes for developers reading the code. In Python, comments start with the hash symbol # and extend to the end of the line.
For example, # This is a comment provides a comment explaining the code that follows.

Comments are invaluable for improving code readability and documenting functionality.

Keywords and Identifiers: Python has a set of reserved words, known as keywords, that cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.). Examples of keywords include if, else, for, while, def, and return.
Identifiers must follow certain rules, such as starting with a letter or underscore, and can contain letters, digits, and underscores.

# Example of keywords and identifiers
# 'def' is a keyword, 'greet' is an identifier
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name + "!")
