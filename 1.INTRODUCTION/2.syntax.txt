Syntax Basics in Python



Welcome back to our Python programming journey! In this video, we're going to delve into the fundamental aspect of Python programming: syntax basics. Understanding the syntax of a programming language is crucial as it forms the foundation upon which you'll build your code.

Let's start by discussing some key elements of Python syntax:

Indentation: Python uses indentation to indicate block structure. This means that instead of using braces {}, like many other programming languages, Python relies on consistent indentation to define code blocks.
When using conditionals or loops, such as if statements or for loops, the indented code underneath them is considered part of the block.
such as :

if True:
    print("This line is indented")

Statements and Expressions: In Python, statements are instructions that perform actions, while expressions are combinations of values and operators that yield results.
For example, assigning a value to a variable (x = 5) is a statement, while performing operations like addition (2 * (x + 3)) is an expression.

Variables and Assignments: Variables are used to store data values. You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator =.
For instance, name = "Alice" assigns the value "Alice" to the variable name, and age = 30 assigns the value 30 to the variable age.
